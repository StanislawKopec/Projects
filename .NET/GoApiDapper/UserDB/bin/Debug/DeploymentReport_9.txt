     Possible data issues
       The type for column Id in table [dbo].[ProductCategories] is currently  FLOAT (53) NULL but is being changed to  INT
         IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL.
       The type for column Id in table [dbo].[Products] is currently  FLOAT (53) NULL but is being changed to  INT IDENTITY (1,
         1) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type 
         INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL.
       The type for column price in table [dbo].[Products] is currently  FLOAT (53) NULL but is being changed to  DECIMAL (18,
         2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type 
         DECIMAL (18, 2) NOT NULL.
       The column [dbo].[Users].[salt] on table [dbo].[Users] must be added, but the column has no default value and does not
         allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add
         a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a
         deployment option.
       The type for column Id in table [dbo].[Users] is currently  FLOAT (53) NULL but is being changed to  INT IDENTITY (1, 1)
         NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type  INT
         IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL.
